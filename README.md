# running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Locally`

```sh
project root directory
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode on port 3000.

### `Docker Compose`

running with docker is straight forward. Just run the command below in the project root directory. The application will be started on port 3000

```sh
project root directory
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### `Build`

```sh
project root directory
npm build
```

Builds the application for production to the `build` folder
